# Real-Estate-Price-Prediction
### A Machine Learning Project involving Linear Regression Model using Python as the primary Language.

## End-to-End Project Idea:

Building a **Machine Learning Model**(_Linear Regression Model_) to predict Home prices for several locations.

Writing a **Python Flask Server** that uses the saved model to serve http requests running in back-end.

Making a **user friendly website** that gives the estimated prices for different regions.

This project deals with the Data Science Concepts:
- *Data load and data Cleaning*
- *Feature Engineering*
- *One Hot Encoding*
- *Outlier Detection*
- *Dimentionality Reduction*
- *Grid Search CV for hyperparameter tuning*
- *K-fold cross validation and more*


# Tools Used 
- Jupyter Notebook
- PyCharm
- Git
- Visual Studio Code
- Postman

The necessary Python Libraries to install...
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib [data processing]
- sk learn [model making]
- flask [making the back-end flask server]
